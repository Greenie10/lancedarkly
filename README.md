# LanceDarkly

## Problem

Switching between VS Code, LaunchDarkly web app and other internal integrations is inconvenient. Would be great if there was an extension to find a toggle and related information.

## Contribution (Get Started)

- `npm i`
- `npm run build` watches files changed for webviews and rebuilds the React app
- **F5** to run in VS code
- `npm test`
